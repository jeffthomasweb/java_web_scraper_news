# java_web_scraper_news
A webscraper for the https://text.npr.org website built using Java and the Spring Framework. Project setup with Gradle. Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. Link to the project http://3.23.49.40/index.html . I haven't connected the site to a website domain nor have I setup a TLS certificate so the site will probably say "not secure" on some browsers (the site uses http rather than https.)
